NON-FEATURE TODOS
 - type -> cardType
 - remove "special" field
 - extract repeating code parts to functions
 - refactor deck.js to create same type cards via spread operator
 - refactor cards to test by type instead of id (e.g. cardId < 0)
 - rewrite code to assignment- instead of references-based functions (???)


 WHEN GAME FINISHED
